# PHP Email Scrip

This will be a simple PHP scrip to send an email based on a POST from a form. We will make 2 versions of this
* one using a PHP POST in an HTML From
* Another using a React Component and JS helper function to POST the output of the form

Between these 2 front ends the slight differences in handling POST input should be made clear to help better understand the basic PHP logic needed when dealing with email; and serve to create a start scrip most can use to add this to any site they work on.

##### IN PROGRESS, pushing up in my free time....
